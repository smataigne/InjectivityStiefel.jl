# InjectivityStiefel.jl
This repository is associated to the publication "The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold".
This repository contains de following folders: `src`and `plots`.
`src` contains two files. 
`skewlog` contains a routine to compute the skew-symmetric matrix logarithm of an orthogonal matrix.
`check_injectivity_radius.jl` contains the algorithm corroborating the injectivity radius on the Stiefel manifold and subroutines.
To run the Julia installation should have the following packages installed: `LinearAlgebra`, `SkewLinearAlgebra`, `Plots`, `LaTeXStrings`, `Colors`.
